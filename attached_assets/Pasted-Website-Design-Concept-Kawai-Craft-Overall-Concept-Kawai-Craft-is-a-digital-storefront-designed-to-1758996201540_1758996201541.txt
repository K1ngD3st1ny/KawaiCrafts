Website Design Concept: Kawai Craft
Overall Concept: Kawai Craft is a digital storefront designed to be a vibrant, joyful, and trustworthy hub for anime fans. The design philosophy merges the energetic aesthetic of modern Japanese pop culture with the clean, intuitive user experience of a top-tier e-commerce platform. The goal is to make finding and buying your next papercraft project as fun as building it.

1. Design System & Brand Identity
Logo: The name Kawai Craft in a rounded, bubbly font. The 'C' in 'Craft' is stylized to look like a pair of craft scissors or an origami fold. A small, cute mascot (like a happy paper crane or a chibi ninja holding a craft knife) could be part of the logo lockup.

Color Palette:

Primary: Soft Pastel Pink (#FFD1DC) and Serene Lavender (#E6E6FA). Used for backgrounds and large UI panels.

Secondary: Muted Charcoal (#36454F) for primary text, ensuring readability.

Accent: Electric Neon Cyan (#00FFFF) and Vibrant Magenta (#FF00FF). Used for call-to-action buttons, hover effects, and highlights to create a dynamic contrast.

Typography:

Headings: A playful but clear, rounded sans-serif font like Baloo 2 or Fredoka One. (e.g., <h1>Kawai Craft</h1>).

Body Text: A clean, highly-readable sans-serif like Nunito or M PLUS Rounded 1c.

Iconography: Custom-designed icons with a soft, rounded style. Icons for 'Cart', 'Search', 'User Profile', and social media will have a friendly, 'kawaii' feel.

UI Elements:

Buttons: Pill-shaped with soft drop shadows. Primary CTAs use a neon accent color with a subtle glow on hover.

Cards: Product cards and panels have rounded corners and a gentle box-shadow to make them "float" above the subtle background.
