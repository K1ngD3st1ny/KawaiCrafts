# Kawai Craft Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
Reference-Based Approach inspired by modern anime e-commerce platforms like Crunchyroll Store and kawaii-focused marketplaces, merged with clean e-commerce patterns from Shopify and Etsy.

## Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Soft Pastel Pink: 330 100% 91%
- Serene Lavender: 240 67% 94%
- Muted Charcoal: 200 22% 25%

**Accent Colors:**
- Electric Neon Cyan: 180 100% 50%
- Vibrant Magenta: 300 100% 50%

**Background Treatments:**
Subtle gradient overlays using pastel pink to lavender transitions, very low-opacity anime-themed patterns (cherry blossoms, stars) that don't compete with content.

## Typography
- **Headings:** Baloo 2 or Fredoka One (rounded, playful sans-serif)
- **Body Text:** Nunito or M PLUS Rounded 1c (clean, readable sans-serif)
- **Hierarchy:** Large hero titles, medium section headers, comfortable body text sizing

## Layout System
Tailwind spacing units: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 for consistent rhythm
- Mobile: Single column, comfortable padding
- Desktop: Multi-column grids with generous gutters

## Component Library

### Navigation
- Sticky header with logo left, search center, cart/user right
- Hamburger menu for mobile
- Prominent search bar with anime-themed placeholder text

### Product Cards
- Rounded corners with soft shadows
- Cover art thumbnails
- Series tags with anime branding colors
- Clean typography hierarchy
- Subtle hover animations (5% scale, neon glow)

### Buttons
- Pill-shaped primary buttons
- Neon cyan for CTAs with subtle glow
- Soft shadows and smooth transitions
- Rounded, kawaii-inspired styling

### Shopping Cart & Checkout
- Modal cart overlay
- Single-page checkout flow
- Large, secure-looking payment buttons
- Clear download sections post-purchase

## Key Sections

### Hero Section
Large anime-style banner illustration featuring popular characters in chibi form crafting papercraft figures. Text overlay with site branding and primary CTA.

### Featured Series
Horizontal scrolling logo carousel of popular anime series

### Product Grid
Responsive grid (1-2 mobile, 4-5 desktop) with infinite scroll or pagination

### How It Works
Three-step visual guide with cute kawaii icons

## Images
- **Hero Image:** Large anime-style banner illustration showing chibi characters crafting papercraft (covers full viewport width)
- **Product Images:** High-quality PDF cover art thumbnails for each catalogue
- **Series Logos:** Official anime series logos for filtering/navigation
- **Icon Set:** Custom kawaii-styled icons for UI elements (cart, search, user, social media)
- **Background Patterns:** Very subtle, low-opacity anime motifs (cherry blossoms, stars, shuriken)

## Animations
Minimal and purposeful:
- Product card hover effects (scale + glow)
- Smooth button transitions
- Cart counter updates
- Loading states for downloads

## Mobile Considerations
Mobile-first responsive design with collapsed navigation, adjusted grid layouts, and touch-friendly interactions. Maintain kawaii aesthetic while prioritizing usability.
